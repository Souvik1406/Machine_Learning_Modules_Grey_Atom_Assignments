John is a customer with enought savings ready to but a house. He has scrolled through various websites and has finally been able to jot down a number of options as a relevant
Excel sheet. 
He is done with his so called <EXPLORATION>
Now that John is done exploring and has tested all the factors affecting the price of a house using inferential statistics, he wants to get better understanding of the statistics.
After a bit of furthur research he has realised that he will have to operate different rows and columns to get the bigger picture. 
His exploration is about to get the touch of MACHINE LEARNING AND DATA SCIENCE .... so look into the project to see how.
